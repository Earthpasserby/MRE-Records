              <p class="text-justify p-4">
                Gil, who’s also the founder of MRE, is a melodic & storytelling
                rapper, singer and record producer, known for combining both
                rapping and singing in English and Spanish, while touching on
                different relatable subjects like heartbreak, feeling left out,
                chasing your dreams, world conflicts - Gil uses different types
                of sounds and beat switches throughout his songs. Although born
                in Israel, Gil left with his parents to Malaga, Spain, where he
                learned Spanish and spent the first 10 years of his life. Being
                a foreign kid in a new country inspired his multicultural side
                before returning to Rishon LeZion, Israel with his family in
                2012. Gil started releasing music on all platforms independently
                using beats he found on YouTube in 2019. In 2021, during his
                service in the IDF he released an EP titled “Exclamation!” and a
                follow-up single “Nobody’s Safe” but barely got any recognition.
                He decided to go on a year and a half hiatus in order to work on
                his debut album, “Red Roses & Purple Hearts”, independently
                while finishing up his service in the army. In early-mid 2023 he
                started gaining recognition from the underground Israeli rap
                scene, while releasing the singles for his highly anticipated
                debut album - “DGAF Anymore”, “MRE” featuring world famous
                Griselda rapper - Benny the Butcher and “Fuckin’ It Up”. Gil's
                debut album “Red Roses & Purple Hearts” was released on October
                3rd, 2023.
